# One design feature was to have a clear separation between the input and output of PROFOIL has been maintained
# meaning profoil.in file has nothing to do with what is been extracted to do the plots and vice versa. 
# For each output file [profoil.xy, profoil.dmp, profoil.vel] there exists a corresponding extract_{} function,
# which extracts the required information from the files with the following data types.

# +-------------+---------------+----------------+
# | File        | Data          | Extracted Type |

# As for the input, the main functionality is encapsulated into gen_input_template(...), and gen_input_file(...) functions. 
# The first one creates a substitutable string by de-voiding FOIL and ILE lines mainly.

    main point to understand is, whatever the data not represented as f(x) has to be
    transformed into f(x), using splines in the form of spl(phi). popular interp1d spline
    is used here which appears to work without any issue given phi increases monotonically.
    Additionally, for the airfoil contour, x(phi) and y(phi) has to be constructed because
    the markers are given in phi.
